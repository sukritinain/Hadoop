Program to produce an inverted index.  For example, given the following documents: 
	d1.txt: cat dog cat fox
	d2.txt: cat bear cat cat fox
	d3.txt: fox wolf dog

output should be following full inverted index.

	bear: 1 : {(d2.txt,1)}
	cat : 2 : {(d1.txt, 2), (d2.txt, 3)}
	dog : 2 : {(d1.txt, 1), (d3.txt, 1)}
	fox : 3 : {(d1.txt, 1), (d2.txt, 1), (d3.txt, 1)}
	wolf: 1 : {(d2.txt,1)}

For each term (word), there is a single record consisting of a number and a list of what are termed postings; the semicolon character (‘:’) is used to delimit the fields of each record. The first field is a number that represents the number of documents that contain the term. Then a list of postings follows where each posting is a pair consisting of the document name and the frequency of the word in that specific document.
